### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in Vagrant (And Terminal.)

Example : `node lunch.js`

Work on your code iteratively â€“ that means in small pieces. This allows you to ensure each change works making it easier to notice a issue.

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows:

``` javascript
function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime) {
  console.log("hungry is ", hungry);
  console.log("availableTime is ", availableTime);
}

```
